        <h5>14. Celtics - Kevin Porter Jr., G/F, USC</h5>
        <p>
          Stats: 41 games, 9.6 PPG, 3.1 REB, 2.0 AST, 45.3 FG%, 33.6 3PT%, 70.3

        <p>
          Along with Tyler Herro and Eric Paschall, Kevin Porter Jr. has been
          one of the most pleasant surprises of the draft at pick 30. While he
          has tendencies to be a black hole on offense, Porter Jr. is a volume
          scorer that could provide a nice spark off the bench for the Celtics.
          He’s also only 19 years old and could definitely improve his
          playmaking ability - if anyone could optimize his talents, it’s Brad
          Stevens. While the Celtics are already loaded at the wing positions
          with Brown, Tatum and Hayward, Porter Jr. is too good of a talent to
          pass up with the last pick in the lottery.

        {/* Heat */}
        <h5>13. Heat - Coby White, PG, North Carolina</h5>
        <p>
          Stats: 54 games, 11.1 PPG, 3.5 REB, 2.3 AST, 37.2% FG, 33.9% 3PT,

        </p>
        <p>
          Coby White has been pretty solid for the Bulls so far this season, and
          would be a nice addition to the already loaded Heat bench. He needs to
          improve his efficiency and playmaking ability, but White is a good
          shooter with size (6-4) to suggest he has the potential to be a
          lockdown defender at the PG position.
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - Tyler Herro</p>
        {/* Hornets */}
        <h5>12. Hornets - Cam Reddish, G/F, Duke</h5>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Cam Reddish is one of the hardest players to gauge in this redraft,
          and I’m sure he was one of the hardest players to gauge in the actual
          draft, too. He isn’t efficient at all (and wasn’t at Duke, either),
          yet he keeps having games or making plays that showcase his potential
          and the All-Star type player he could become. While he may be one of
          the riskiest picks in the lottery, Reddish’s ceiling is probably close
          to the top 5 of players in this draft. A risk the Hornets, who are
          desperately in need of a star player after the departure of Kemba,
          should definitely take at this point in the draft.{" "}

        <p>Original pick - PJ Washington</p>
        {/* Suns */}
        <h5>11. Suns (from Timberwolves) - Eric Paschall, F, Villanova</h5>

          FT%,
        </p>
        <p>
          Eric Paschall is the only second round pick going in this lottery
          redraft - props to the Warriors and their scouting department for
          finding yet another gem. Paschall’s numbers may be more inflated than
          the other rookies on this list due to his opportunity and the fact he
          plays 27 minutes a game, but he is still a solid player that could
          come in and potentially start at the 4 for Phoenix. Like Rui, Paschall
          will have to improve his ability to shoot the three, but he is still a
          solid player that deserves to go in the lottery.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - Cameron Johnson</p>
        {/* Hawks */}
        <h5>10. Hawks - Cameron Johnson, F, North Carolina</h5>
        <p>
          Stats: 41 games, 7.7 PPG, 2.9 REB, 1.1 AST, 40.9% FG, 38.7% 3PT, 75.0%
          FT
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, Cameron Johnson is older than everyone on this list at 23 years
          old. But, man, can he shoot. Johnson is already making threes at a 39%
          clip and would fit in seamlessly with the Hawks. Johnson and their
          next selection spacing the floor on the wings with Trae Young, John
          Collins, and Clint Capela running pick-and-rolls is an intriguing team
          that I may have to go test out in 2K after I’m done writing this.
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - Cam Reddish</p>
        {/* Wizards */}
        <h5>9. Wizards - PJ Washington, F, Kentucky</h5>

          FT%
        </p>
        <p>
          PJ Washington would complement Beal very well with the Wizards. He’s a
          solid scorer with good size that can stretch the floor from three. One
          thing he will need to work on is his consistency, but I expect that
          will get better with more time in the league. PJ should be a starter
          in the league for the next decade or so.
        </p>
        <p>Original Pick - Rui Hachimura</p>
        {/* Pelicans */}
        <h5>8. Pelicans (from Hawks) - Brandon Clarke, F, Gonzaga</h5>
        <p>
          Stats: 46 games, 12.0 PPG, 5.7 REB, 1.4 AST, 61.4 FG%, 42.0 3PT%, 80.5
          FT%
        </p>
        <p>
          Pairing Zion with Brandon Clarke isn’t exactly ideal from a positional
          standpoint, but Clarke is too good of a player to pass up here. Also,
          Zion has a lot of positional flexibility and could easily be on the
          court at the same time as Clarke. Clarke has only played about 22
          minutes a game with the Grizzlies, but he’s certainly made an impact
          while on the floor. Coming out of Gonzaga, I really liked Clarke
          because of his defense, athleticism, and ability to rebound. What I
          really underestimated about Clarke was his immediate offensive
          contribution - he’s a capable shooter with a nice touch close to the
          rim.

        <p>Original pick - Jaxson Hayes</p>
        {/* Bulls */}
        <h5>7. Bulls - Darius Garland, PG, Vanderbilt</h5>
        <p>
          Stats: 52 games, 12.2 PPG, 3.8 AST, 1.9 REB, 39.3% FG, 35.4% 3PT,
          86.6% FT
        </p>
        <p>
          Darius Garland could simply replace the role Coby White has right now
          on the Bulls as a role player that could provide a spark off the bench
          with his ability to shoot the three ball. Although both need to work
          on their overall FG effectiveness, Garland is a better shooter and
          flashes a little bit more overall potential as a playmaker. Garland
          would be a slight upgrade for the Bulls at PG here.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - Coby White</p>
        {/* Timberwolves */}
        <h5>6. Timberwolves (from Suns) - Rui Hachimura, PF, Gonzaga</h5>
        <p>
          Stats: 28 games, 13.9 PPG, 6.1 REB, 1.5 AST, 48.5% FG, 24.1% 3PT,
          81.7% FT
        </p>
        <p>
          Rui has been one of the most impressive rookies to me. I love the idea
          of pairing him at PF with Towns at C for the Timberwolves. One thing
          he will need to improve upon is his three-point shot, as it’s tougher
          for big-men to be as effective in the league without stretching the
          floor these days. Nonetheless, Hachimura could come in and instantly
          provide value for the Timberwolves.
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - Jarrett Culver</p>
        {/* Cavs */}
        <h5>5. Cavaliers - De’Andre Hunter, F, Virginia</h5>

          Stats: 52 games, 12.2 PPG, 3.9 REB, 1.8 AST, 41.2% FG, 34.4% 3PT,
          76.3% FT
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cavaliers need to take the best player available here, who, at
          this point, I believe is Hunter. Although they should draft the best
          available player, I really like the fit here with Hunter in Cleveland
          due to their glaring needs at the wing positions. Hunter would
          immediately provide defense and a winning-mentality to this young and
          inexperienced Cavs team.{" "}

        {/* Hawks */}
        <h5>
          4. Hawks (originally Lakers, traded to Hawks from Pelicans) - Tyler
          Herro, SG, Kentucky

        <p>
          Stats: 46 games, 13.1 PPG, 4.0 REB, 2.0 AST, 41.4% FG, 39.3% 3PT,

        <p>
          Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Tyler Herro, Zach LaVine. Man, pretty
          soon teams are going to be straight up swapping higher picks just to
          get to that coveted 13 spot. Tyler Herro has been one of the best
          rookies in the league so far. He’s an exceptional shooter (39.3% from
          three) and would fit extremely well in Atlanta and the system they are
          trying to build there around Trae Young.
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - De’Andre Hunter</p>
        {/* Knicks */}
        <h5>3. Knicks - RJ Barrett, SG, Duke</h5>

          Stats: 44 games, 13.6 PPG, 5.1 REB, 2.5 AST, 39.0% FG, 32.7% 3PT,
          59.9% FT
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an obvious drop off after Zion and Ja are off the board, but
          I’m sticking with the Knicks original pick here - RJ Barrett. Barrett
          has struggled at times with his shot selection and efficiency, but he
          has too much potential to pass up at 3. An undervalued aspect of his
          game is his playmaking ability. While RJ is only averaging 2.5 assists
          a game, his ability to get in the lane and set up open teammates is
          apparent. I wish the Knicks would abandon their lost season and try to
          get their young guys more minutes/experience, but that’s an article
          for a different day. Barrett is still the pick here.
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - RJ Barrett</p>
        {/* Grizzlies */}
        <h5>2. Grizzlies - Ja Morant, PG, Murray State</h5>

          FT%
        </p>
        <p>
          Ja Morant is the clear favorite for Rookie of the Year, and rightfully
          so. He has made a huge impact on the Grizzlies since day one, having
          them right in the middle of the playoff hunt in the West. No small
          feat for someone who is just 20 years old. Ja should be at least in
          the conversation for one of the best point guards in the league in the
          next 5-10 years.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>Original pick - Ja Morant</p>
        {/* Pelicans */}
        <h5>1. New Orleans Pelicans - Zion Williamson, Forward, Duke</h5>

          FT%
        </p>
        <p>
          While Zion has only played in eight games up to this point, we already
          have more than enough evidence suggesting that he’s exactly the kind
          of difference maker we thought he would be coming out of Duke. He has
          the making of a perennial All-Star as long as he can stay healthy.{" "}
