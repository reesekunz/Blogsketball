        {/* Monte Morris */}
        <h5>10. Monte Morris, Denver</h5>
        <p>Stats: 8.5 PPG, 3.6 AST, 1.8 REB, 45.9 FG%, 40.2 3PT%, 80.0 FT%</p>
        <p>
          Monte Morris is constantly atop the league in assist-to-turnover ratio
          (currently in first with a 5.5 ratio). He takes care of the ball and
          shoots three pointers at a 40% rate. Morris is the ideal playmaker you
          want coming off the bench that literally never gets talked about.
        </p>
        {/* Jerami Grant */}
        <h5>9. Jerami Grant, Denver</h5>
        <p>Stats: 11.3 PPG, 1.1 AST, 3.7 REB, 46.8 FG%, 39.7 3PT%, 73.1 FT%</p>
        <p>
          Jerami Grant has quietly turned himself into an extremely athletic
          stretch-four in today’s NBA, which is a dangerous thought. Grant has
          become a much more capable floor spacer since coming into the league,
          and has a lot of length/athleticism to really make an impact
          defensively as well. He’s another solid role player that doesn’t get
          enough credit from casual fans.
        </p>
        {/* Buddy Hield */}
        <h5>8. Buddy Hield, Sacramento</h5>
        <p>Stats: 20.4 PPG, 3.2 AST, 5.0 REB, 43.1 FG%, 38.5 3PT%, 83.0 FT%</p>
        <p>
          Buddy Hield recently defeated Devin Booker in an epic three point
          contest during the All-Star festivities, just further illustrating how
          well this man can shoot the ball. Yes, he has been relatively
          struggling this year with the Kings, but I personally never would have
          benched him. Hield is a bonafide scorer and is the exact type player I
          would want to be my “third guy” on a championship team. People don’t
          give him enough credit simply because he’s in Sacramento, but don’t
          sleep on Hield.
        </p>
        {/* Lonzo Ball */}
        <h5>7. Lonzo Ball, New Orleans</h5>
        <p>Stats: 11.9 PPG, 6.7 AST, 6.1 REB, 40.0 FG%, 36.6 3PT%, 56.6 FT%</p>
        <p>
          It’s hard to be a point guard that struggles with his shot in today’s
          NBA, but Lonzo seems to be shooting a lot more confidently this year
          with the Pelicans. Lonzo is one of my favorite players to watch in the
          NBA because of the way he plays; he does all the little things to help
          his team win and is constantly looking to get his teammates involved.
          Ball is only considered underrated because of how big of a spotlight
          and (somewhat unrealistic) expectations people had for him coming into
          the league. He seems to have found a home in New Orleans.
        </p>
        {/* Malik Beasley */}
        <h5>6. Malik Beasley, Minnesota</h5>
        <p>Stats: 8.9 PPG, 1.3 AST, 2.2 REB, 39.5 FG%, 37.1 3PT%, 86.0 FT%</p>
        <p>
          Malik Beasley recently got traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and
          his numbers have significantly spiked as a result. It’s only been
          three games since being traded, but Beasley has averaged 22.0 points,
          6.7 rebounds, and 3.0 assists so far. Although I’d like him to be a
          little more efficient, Beasley is a very talented scorer and has a
          much better opportunity to optimize his talent in Minnesota.
        </p>
        {/* Derrick White */}
        <h5>5. Derrick White, San Antonio</h5>
        <p>Stats: 10.2 PPG, 3.4 AST, 3.1 REB, 45.8 FG%, 35.8 3PT%, 84.9 FT%</p>
        <p>
          Derrick White was just recently named as one of 44 finalists to make
          the USA Olympic roster. While his name definitely stands out as
          someone that probably shouldn’t be on there, the fact that Gregg
          Popovich had him making it at least this far is a testament to the
          kind of talent and character White has. Like others on this list,
          White has worked hard on his shot and continues to show improvements
          in his efficiency. The future of the Spurs’ point guard position is in
          good hands with Dejounte Murray (23 years old) and Derrick White (25).
        </p>
        {/* Mikal Bridges */}
        <h5>4. Mikal Bridges, Phoenix</h5>
        <p>Stats: 8.1 PPG, 1.6 AST, 3.9 REB, 50.6 FG%, 34.5 3PT%, 82.0 FT%</p>
        <p>
          Mikal Bridges is my favorite player to watch on the Suns. He is
          already very impressive defensively and reminds me a bit of Andre
          Iguodala on that side of the ball. Although he has a bit of a hitch in
          his shot, Bridges shoots at a respectable 34.5% clip from three. If he
          improve his form and make it more consistent, Bridges could really
          refine his role as one of the best 3-and-D role players in the NBA.
        </p>
        {/* Donte DiVincenzo */}
        <h5>3. Donte DiVincenzo, Milwaukee</h5>
        <p>Stats: 9.2 PPG, 2.2 AST, 4.7 REB, 45.6 FG%, 34.4 3PT%, 77.6 FT%</p>
        <p>
          DiVincenzo is most known for his MVP performance in the 2018 National
          Championship game where he scored 31 points and led Villanova to a
          convincing win over Michigan. What a lot of casual NBA fans don’t
          know, however, is how well his game has translated to the next level.
          DiVincenzo was viewed as sort of a tweener combo-guard coming into the
          NBA. He struggled with his shot in his rookie season, shooting 26.5%
          3PT%. But he’s really improved his shooting and now is at a
          respectable 34.4 3PT%. Combine his improved shooting with his existing
          playmaking and defensive abilities, and Donte DiVincenzo now plays an
          integral role coming off the bench for the Bucks. Catalyzed by
          DiVincenzo, the Bucks’ depth is a big reason they currently have the
          best record in the league.
        </p>
        {/* Joe Ingles */}
        <h5>2. Joe Ingles, Utah</h5>
        <p>Stats: 10.0 PPG, 5.2 AST, 4.0 REB, 43.3 FG%, 39.6 3PT%, 78.9 FT%</p>
        <p>
          Joe Ingles is a popular pick as an underrated player, but I agree that
          he doesn’t receive the credit he deserves. A lot of it has to do with
          his appearance - Joe Ingles looks like he plays basketball at your
          local YMCA (and he’d probably be the first to tell you that). But,
          Ingles really knows how to play basketball at a high level. He is a
          solid playmaker with a high basketball IQ, averaging 5.2 assists a
          game. Combine that with the fact that he shoots almost 40% from three,
          and it’s clear Ingles isn’t talked about as much as he should be.
        </p>
        {/* Dorian Finney-Smith */}
        <h5>1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Dallas</h5>
        <p>
          2019-20 Stats: 9.4 PPG, 1.5 AST, 5.6 REB, 46.1 FG%, 38.2 3PT%, 72.3
          FT%
        </p>
        <p>
          Dorian Finney-Smith is extremely underrated in today’s NBA, which
          heavily values 3-and-D players. He’s 6’8 and has worked hard to
          improve his three point shot, increasing his percentage from last year
          from 31.1% to 38.2%. Finney-Smith is a solid floor spacer for Luka
          Doncic and his combination of length and athleticism allows him to be
          an effective defender. Finney-Smith is my pick for the most underrated
          player in the NBA.
