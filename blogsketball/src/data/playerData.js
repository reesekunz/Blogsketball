      '"If you want to look good in front of thousands, you have to out work thousands in front of nobody." - Damian Lillard ',
      "Dame Dolla is not only a rapper, he's the best point guard in the NBA this season. He's also one of my personal favorite players. Something I really admire about him is his loyalty to the Trail Blazers organization.",
      "Lillard has stuck with the Blazers through thick and thin all 8 seasons he’s been in the league. He’s repeatedly said that he wants to win with them instead of taking his talents elsewhere, which is pretty rare these days with stars like LeBron and Durant switching teams to increase their odds of winning a championship.",
      "Lillard, like his teammate, CJ McCollum, Stephen Curry, and a couple others in the league, is another guard that was selected with a high pick coming out of a small school that has had tremendous success. He was only a 2-star prospect coming out of high school and is an excellent example of someone who has outworked everyone else to get to where he is today.",
      "Last season, Dame led the Blazers to his first ever Western Conference Finals. The most memorable play during that playoff run was his 37-foot game-winning 3 that eliminated the Thunder from the playoffs (yes, I bet on the Thunder to win that game.. It’s fine. I’m fine).",
      "In my opinion, Damian Lillard is the second best point guard, which is even more impressive in a guard-heavy league like today's NBA. Westbrook may have an MVP on his resume, and Kyrie Irving may have a championship, but I’m taking Dame Dolla over both of them 10 times out of 10."

      "Devin Booker needed a Damian Lillard injury to get into his first all-star game this season, but something tells me that if the players themselves were voting he would have EASILY been in. DBook has a ton of respect from players around the league, but is oftentimes underappreciated outside of players because of the lack of team success the Suns have had.",
      "Booker was underrated coming into the league, too, as he was picked 13th overall out of Kentucky. A large part of the reason was his lack of opportunity to shine at Kentucky, which was loaded at the time. Booker only played 21.5 minutes per game and averaged 10.0 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.1 assists. Scouts were enamored with his shooting, but many underestimated his scoring and playmaking ability.",
      " Booker’s efficiency has increased since the Suns signed Ricky Rubio this past offseason to allow Booker to focus more on scoring and less on orchestrating the offense. Last season, he had shooting splits of 46/32/86, compared to this season where he is shooting 49/36/91.",
      "As long as Devin Booker stays healthy, he should be a perennial all-star in the league. Booker is only 23 and hasn’t even entered his prime yet, which is a scary thought for the rest of the league.",
      "Before Kobe Bryant passed away, he challenged Devin Booker to “be legendary.” It’s safe to say Booker has been fulfilling that challenge so far.",

Here’s what he actually reminds me of: Shawn Kemp - height, athleticism, ability to drive to the hoop. David Robinson - height, athleticism, ball handling ability relative to size.

That might have been true when Giannis first came into the league, but he has worked extremely hard to become a top 3 player in the league and definitely deserves more respect than this.",
      " One thing that will determine how highly Giannis is regarded in terms of where he falls on the all-time list is whether or not he wins a championship. The Bucks have had a historical season and could certainly win it all when the season resumes. But, until he gets that ring, it’s hard to put him in the same conversation as guys like Kevin Durant."

Brown came into the league with a shooting split of 45/34/69, but is now much more efficient, shooting 49/38/74. His ability to shoot the three ball and combination of athleticism and solid instincts on the defensive end is why I compare him to a poor man’s Kawhi Leonard.",

    summary: [
      '   "What strikes me? His agility and his quickness. For his size, how strong he is, to be able to move like the way he moves, he is very impressive. I mean, everybody can see the athleticism. That is ridiculous. But the speed and the quickness that he moves [with] at that size is very impressive." - LeBron James',
      "    Zion Williamson may be the most covered basketball teenager since LeBron James, and he’s already justified the amount of attention he’s been receiving only 19 games into the league. Obviously Zion is a walking highlight reel - he set a Duke record of a 45 inch vertical.. at 280 pounds. But, what some people don’t realize about Zion is the intangibles he brings to the table to help his team win. He’s the type of player that can have a significant impact on a game and only score 10 points.",
      "  He’s also an amazing kid with the type of character you would want from someone who could potentially be the face of the league alongside guys like Luka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Zion recently pledged to cover the salaries of the Smoothie King Center employees for the next 30 days with the season being postponed due to the coronavirus.",
      "  Some people are concerned about the fact that Zion weighs 280 pounds, claiming that he is more susceptible to injury because of it. That may be at least somewhat valid, but Zion’s rare combination of elite size and athleticism is what makes him such a unique and dynamic player. He’s virtually unguardable if he’s already going downhill - and the scary thought is that he hasn’t even had enough experience yet to fully figure out how to optimize his skillset.",
      "     Zion is an incredibly gifted athlete that has the potential to be an MVP in the league. At the very worst, assuming he stays healthy, Zion will have multiple all-star appearances on his resume. It’s safe to say the Pelicans have a new face of the franchise."
